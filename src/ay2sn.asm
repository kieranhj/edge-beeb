\ ******************************************************************
\ * ay2sn.asm - the runtime AY-3-8912 -> SN76489 layer, for measurement
\ *
\ * The offline chain (ym2sn.py) does this once, with whole-song
\ * analysis. A tracker replay on the BBC has to do it every frame.
\ * This is what that costs.
\ *
\ * Tone:   the CPC AY runs at 1 MHz and the SN at 4 MHz, so
\ *         SN period = 2 * AY period exactly - ym2sn's own formula
\ *         reduces to that. Periods over ten bits are halved until
\ *         they fit, which is the octave-up ym2sn does as well.
\ * Volume: AY 4-bit volume -> 5-bit -> a 32-entry attenuation LUT,
\ *         the same mapping ym2sn builds.
\ * Noise:  AY 5-bit noise period -> one of the SN's three rates.
\ * Envelope: there is ONE envelope generator on the AY, so one phase
\ *         accumulator. It is SAMPLED once a frame, not averaged over
\ *         the frame the way ym2sn does. That is the cheap option and
\ *         it is audibly not the same thing - see the report.
