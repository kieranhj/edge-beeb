\ ******************************************************************
\ * ay2sn.asm - the runtime AY-3-8912 -> SN76489 layer, for measurement
\ *
\ * The offline chain (ym2sn.py) does this once, with whole-song
\ * analysis. A tracker replay on the BBC has to do it every frame.
\ * This is what that costs.
\ *
\ * Tone:   the CPC AY runs at 1 MHz and the SN at 4 MHz, so
\ *         SN period = 2 * AY period exactly - ym2sn's own formula
\ *         reduces to that. Periods over ten bits are halved until
\ *         they fit, which is the octave-up ym2sn does as well.
\ * Volume: AY 4-bit volume -> 5-bit by duplicating the low bit -> a
\ *         32-entry attenuation LUT. Both halves are ym2sn's DEFAULT
\ *         settings, not its dB-faithful -t option; see make_tables.py.
\ * Noise:  AY 5-bit noise period -> the nearest of the SN's three fixed
\ *         rates by frequency, which is ym2sn's choice. The fourth rate
\ *         clocks the noise from tone generator 3 and is never a drum:
\ *         it is the periodic-noise bass, bass_mode 2 below.
\ * Envelope: there is ONE envelope generator on the AY, so one phase
\ *         accumulator. It is SAMPLED once a frame, not averaged over
\ *         the frame the way ym2sn does. That is the cheap option and
\ *         it is audibly not the same thing - see the report.
\ *
\ * TWO THINGS THE HOST HAS TO KNOW:
\ *
\ * 1. CALL THIS WITH INTERRUPTS OFF, or from an interrupt handler.
\ *    DDRA is set ONCE on entry and every SN write after that relies on
\ *    it still being set, so nothing that changes DDRA may run in the
\ *    middle - and the MOS's own 100 Hz keyboard scan does. A VSync IRQ
\ *    handler already has the I flag set and needs nothing; anywhere
\ *    else, wrap the call in sei/cli. It is worth ~60 cycles a call and
\ *    it is what lets sn_write leave X and Y alone.
\ *
\ * 2. THE CHIP'S REGISTERS ARE CACHED (sn_cache_*). A tone or volume
\ *    byte is only sent when the register does not already hold it,
\ *    which is 44-81% of them - see docs/performance.md. Anything that
\ *    writes the SN behind this layer's back must call sn_forget, or
\ *    the cache goes on claiming it knows what is in the chip.
\ ******************************************************************

\ A complete sweep of the AY's 5-bit envelope ladder averages 0.1961 of
\ full amplitude, which is level 12. ym_sn_vol maps that to SN attenuation
\ 9 since the volume curve became ym2sn's (it was 7 under the dB-faithful
\ one). The 0.1961 is a fact about the AY and does not move with the
\ curve; whether the LEVEL is still the right thing to emit once the
\ mapping has changed is an E2/E3 question, and the measurement says it is
\ near enough - EDGEA's volumes went from 28.7% of ym2sn's to 97.4% with
\ this constant untouched, and a third of that tune is envelope.
ENV_MEAN_LEVEL  = 12

\ The envelope completes a whole cycle within one 50 Hz call when its
\ period is 78 or less: 5120000 / 78 > 65536, one full turn of the phase.
ENV_FULL_PERIOD = 78

\ ******************************************************************
\ * BASS_MODE IS THE HOST'S TO DEFINE, before it INCLUDEs this file,
\ * exactly as ENV_BASE is. There is no default: BeebASM cannot ask
\ * whether a symbol exists, so a host that forgets gets a build error
\ * rather than a build it did not choose.
\ *
\ *   BASS_MODE = -1   the host chooses at RUN time, by storing 0, 1 or
\ *                    2 into bass_mode. Every path is assembled. This is
\ *                    what example/demo.asm wants, because its B key
\ *                    cycles the three by ear.
\ *   BASS_MODE = 0    no bass at all: notes below the chip's 122 Hz
\ *                    floor come out an octave high, as they did before
\ *                    any of this existed.
\ *   BASS_MODE = 1    the software voice only. Needs the User VIA timer
\ *                    wired up - see bass_irq below.
\ *   BASS_MODE = 2    the periodic-noise voice only. Needs nothing.
\ *
\ * Measured, AKL on Acid Demo 21, 100 frames, py65 at 2 MHz:
\ *
\ *   -1 (runtime), bass_mode 2   3,685 bytes   2,111 cycles a call
\ *    2 fixed                    3,4xx bytes   2,0xx
\ *   -1 (runtime), bass_mode 0   3,685 bytes   1,988
\ *    0 fixed                    3,0xx bytes   1,8xx
\ *
\ * The cycles are the small half: the five `lda bass_mode` tests are
\ * about 9 cycles a call between them. The bytes are the point, and so
\ * is the fact that a host wanting NO bass pays 118 cycles a call for
\ * the option unless it says so here. docs/performance.md has both.

\ ******************************************************************
\ * The software bass voice
\ *
\ * The SN's period is ten bits, so its lowest note is 122 Hz. Anything
\ * below that used to be shifted up an octave, which is between a third
\ * and nearly half of every tune measured.
\ *
\ * Instead: park the channel's TONE at period 1 - a 125 kHz carrier,
\ * inaudible, and the BBC's analog chain filters it out anyway - and let
\ * a VIA timer toggle that channel's ATTENUATION between the note's
\ * volume and silence at the note's own frequency. The square wave is
\ * generated in the volume domain. The technique is Simon Morris's, from
\ * vgcplayer_bass.asm in vgm-player-bbc.
\ *
\ * It costs no musical channel - the drums and the other two tones are
\ * untouched. It costs a timer and two interrupts per cycle: 102 to
\ * 157 a second on the tunes measured, about 0.5% of the CPU.
\ *
\ * bass_mode 2 is the other answer: the PERIODIC-NOISE bass, which needs
\ * no timer and no interrupts at all but plays on the noise channel, so
\ * the drums take it away whenever they want it - the median song in the
\ * corpus, 10% of its bass calls. See bass_claim's .periodic.
\ *
\ * ONE voice. That is enough for every frame of Rhino's Acid Demo, 83%
\ * of Dead On Time and 91% of EDGEA; the rest octave-shift as before.
\ *
\ * TO USE THE SOFTWARE VOICE the host must:
\ *   1. put User VIA T1 in FREE-RUN mode (ACR bit 6 set, bit 7 clear),
\ *      so it reloads itself and the interrupt only has to toggle;
\ *   2. call bass_irq when User VIA T1 interrupts - and test the flag
\ *      AGAINST THE ENABLE, `lda IFR : and IER : and #&40`. Masking a
\ *      VIA interrupt does not stop its timer, so bit 6 goes on being
\ *      set while T1 is disabled, and testing IFR alone will service
\ *      the bass on the back of every other interrupt in the machine;
\ *   3. set bass_mode to 1.
\ * TO USE THE PERIODIC ONE, set bass_mode to 2. That is all: no timer,
\ * no interrupt, nothing to wire up. Leave bass_mode at 0 and neither
\ * runs - the octave shift stays.
\ *
\ * The bass is only as steady as the interrupt latency, so a host that
\ * disables interrupts for long stretches will hear the pitch wobble.

\ * bass_pick - which channel gets the voice this call, into bass_want.
\ *
\ * There is one voice and a tune can want two, so something has to
\ * choose - and choosing "the first one below the floor" makes the
\ * voice THRASH. Measured on Targhan's Dead On Time: the lowest-numbered
\ * channel below the floor changes on 17.7% of bass calls, with a median
\ * run of ONE call, so the bass would hop between channels 25 times a
\ * second and be retuned every time. (Rhino's tune never changes channel
\ * and EDGEA changes on 2.4%.)
\ *
\ * So it is sticky: if the channel that had the voice last call still
\ * wants it, it keeps it. Only when that channel comes back above the
\ * floor does the voice move, and then to the lowest-numbered claimant.

\ * div15 - snper = round(snper / 15). Exact, and exactly ym2sn's value.
\ *
\ * No loop and no table. 256 = 15*17 + 1, so for x = 256h + l
\ *
\ *     x = 15*17h + (h + l)   and therefore   x/15 = 17h + (h + l)/15
\ *
\ * with h + l at most 287, which the same identity reduces to a single
\ * byte; and for a byte v = 16a + b the remainder feeds back just once,
\ * because a + b is at most 30. So the whole division is two adds, a
\ * nibble swap and two compares.
\ *
\ * Adding 7 first turns the floor into a round, which is what ym2sn's
\ * int(round(sn_tone)) does - proved equal on every value in the range
\ * (snper is 1024 to 8190, a period of 68 to 546). Rounding rather than
\ * truncating matters: at the bottom of the range one step of the period
\ * is 25 cents, and rounding halves the worst error to 11.8 - which is
\ * the chip's own quantisation and no more.
